# Plush Language Guide

This document provides a quick overview of the Plush programming language, its syntax, features, and built-in capabilities. It is intended for developers who want to get started with Plush and learn the basics of the language.

## Introduction

Plush is an experimental toy programming language and virtual machine inspired by JavaScript, Lox, Lua, and Python. It features a simple, minimalistic design with a stack-based bytecode interpreter, actor-based parallelism, and an easily extensible set of host functions.

## Getting Started

To run a Plush script, you can use the `cargo run` command, followed by the path to the script. For example:

```sh
cargo run examples/helloworld.psh
```

This will execute the `helloworld.psh` script and print "Hello, World!" to the console. More example programs
can be found in the [`examples/`](/examples) directory. These examples are available under the

## Language Basics

### Variables

Variables are declared using the `let` keyword. By default, variables are immutable. To declare a mutable variable, use `let var`.

```plush
let x = 10;          // Immutable variable
let var y = 20;      // Mutable variable
y = 30;              // Reassigning a mutable variable
```

Loop counters, which are mutable, must be declared with `let var`, e.g.

```plush
for (let var i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
    $println(i);
```

### Data Types

Plush is a dynamically typed language and supports the following data types:

-   **Int64**: 64-bit signed integers (e.g., `10`, `-5`).
-   **Float64**: 64-bit floating-point numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.5`).
-   **String**: Immutable UTF-8 encoded strings (e.g., `"hello"`, `'world'`).
-   **Bool**: The constants `true` or `false`.
-   **Nil**: The constant `nil` represents the absence of a value.
-   **Array**: Ordered collections of values (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
-   **ByteArray**: Raw, mutable byte buffers.
-   **Object**: Instances of classes.
-   **Dictionaries**: Hash maps with string keys, like JS/Python/JSON (e.g., `{a:1, b: 2}`)

### Operators

Plush supports a range of arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators:

-   **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `_/`, `%`
-   **Comparison**: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
-   **Logical**: `&&`, `||`, `!`

The `_/` operator performs integer division, that is, truncated division which only accepts integer inputs and yields
an integer output, whereas the division operator `/` yields a floating-point value as output.

Note that unlike in JavaScript, the `==` operator performs reference equality for objects and arrays, not structural equality.

### Arrays

The syntax for array literals is similar to that of JavaScript, e.g.

```
let a = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];
```

Array elements an be accessed using the indexing operator with square brackets, e.g. `a[0] = 1`.
ByteArrays can also be indexed using square brackets to read and write individual bytes.
The length of arrays and ByteArrays is accessed via the `.len` field.

### Control Flow

Plush provides `if`/`else` statements for conditional execution and `for` and `while` loops for iteration.

```plush
if (x > 5) {
    $println("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    $println("x is not greater than 5");
}

for (let var i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    $println(i);
}

let var i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
    $println(i);
    i = i + 1;
}
```

### Functions

Functions are defined using the `fun` keyword. They can take arguments and return values.

```plush
fun add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

let result = add(5, 10);
$println(result); // 15
```

### Classes

Plush supports object-oriented programming with classes. Classes are defined using the `class` keyword, and instances are created by calling the class name as a function. Note that the first argument to a method, including `init`, is the explicit `self` argument representing the current object. This argument can have any name, which avoids the JavaScript issue with closures shadowing an implicit `this` argument.

```plush
class Point {
    init(self, x, y) {
        self.x = x;
        self.y = y;
    }

    to_s(self) {
        return "(" + self.x.to_s() + ", " + self.y.to_s() + ")";
    }
}

let p = Point(10, 20);
$println(p.to_s()); // (10, 20)
```

## Built-in Functions and Methods

Plush provides a set of built-in host functions and methods that can be accessed from your code. Host functions are prefixed with a `$` sign.

### Host Functions

-   **Dict**
    -   `has(key)`: Check if the dictionary contains this key.

## Concurrency with Actors

Plush supports actor-based concurrency, which allows you to write parallel programs that are safe and easy to reason about. Actors are independent processes that communicate by sending and receiving messages.

```plush
fun worker() {
    let msg = $actor_recv();
    $println("Received: " + msg);
}

let worker_id = $actor_spawn(worker);
$actor_send(worker_id, "Hello from the main actor!");
$actor_join(worker_id);
```

This example spawns a new worker actor, sends it a message, and then waits for it to complete. The worker receives the message and prints it to the console.

## Debugging

At the moment there is no debugger and you may find that error messages are lackluster. Unsupported behaviors can
result in Rust panics, sometimes without helpful messages. I've been working on gradually improving the error
messages to make Plush more user-friendly, but PRs to improve this are welcome.

To help in debugging, you can print values with `$println()` and you can use the built in `assert()` statement to
validate your assumptions. If you run into a Rust panic with not enough context, you can also run Plush with
`RUST_BACKTRACE=1` to produce a backtrace,
e.g.

```
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run my_program.psh
```

## Manipulating Image Data

In Plush, graphical applications often handle image data directly in memory. This is typically done using `ByteArray` objects, which represent raw, mutable buffers. This approach provides a high degree of control and performance for graphics-intensive tasks.

### Pixel Format: BGRA32

The pixel data for frame buffers is stored in the BGRA32 format. This means that each pixel occupies 4 bytes in memory, with the
blue component at the lowest memory address, and the alpha component at the highest address.
When working with 32-bit integer values to represent colors, this corresponds to a little-endian `0xAARRGGBB` format. Most examples in this project use a helper function to construct color values:

```plush
// Helper function to convert RGB values to a 32-bit color
fun rgb32(r, g, b) {
    // The alpha channel is set to 0xFF (fully opaque)
    return 0xFF000000 | (r << 16) | (g << 8) | b;
}

let red = rgb32(255, 0, 0);
```

### Common Operations

Here are some of the common operations used to manipulate image data stored in a `ByteArray`:

*   **Creating a framebuffer:** A `ByteArray` is created to hold the pixel data for a window or image.
    ```plush
    let frame_buffer = ByteArray.with_size(width * height * 4);
    ```
*   **Setting a single pixel:** The `write_u32` method can be used to set the color of a single pixel at a given `(x, y)` coordinate.
    ```plush
    let index = y * width + x;
    frame_buffer.write_u32(index, color);
    ```
*   **Filling a rectangle:** The `fill_u32` method is an efficient way to fill a rectangular area with a single color.
    ```plush
    // Fills a width x height rectangle at (x, y)
    for (let var j = y; j < y + height; ++j) {
        let start_index = j * width + x;
        frame_buffer.fill_u32(start_index, width, color);
    }
    ```
*   **Clearing the buffer:** The `zero_fill` method can be used to quickly clear the entire buffer to black.
    ```plush
    frame_buffer.zero_fill();
    ```

By manipulating the `ByteArray` directly, you can implement a wide range of graphics effects and rendering techniques.
